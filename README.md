# The Saga of Turd Herder
My app, "Turd Herder," is a simple and fun augmented reality game designed for all ages. Players aim to find and tap ten cartoon "poop" emojis as quickly as possible. Despite the lighthearted content, which includes a cartoonish aesthetic, a humorous musical score, and playful sound effects, Apple has rejected it from the App Store.

The reasons provided for the rejection were initially vague and eventually cited the content as potentially upsetting or offensive. This has been frustrating, especially given the presence of more graphically violent games in the store. Despite extensive efforts to comply with Apple's guidelines and an appeal process, the app remains unapproved, highlighting the challenges faced by independent developers in navigating app store policies.

Since Apple won’t take it, and I put a lot of time into getting ready, I am releasing it, as-is, to the world!

It was written a couple years back, so the code may look “outdated” by today’s standards - it was bleeding-edge when it was first finished.  If I remember correctly, the main core of my code is very much based on a very old tutorial in a Ray Wenderlich book! (I hope I remembered that correctly - it may have been a HWS tutorial!), but if there is interest, I may try to convert it over to SwiftUI.

Have at it! Play with it, let’s make it a community Turd Herder and make it much, much better!

If you have it in your heart, buy me a cup of coffee please! I’m currently looking for work so anything and everything helps!
